# SumOf1To10
THis program summarise numbers from 1 to 10


But not in joke:
I can do better this program in 100000 times... but this project is all i need to do now
In general, I can program better than you can see in my projects,
but I'm not required to, and that's what kills my interest in programming.
I hope to find my programming muse in the near future
